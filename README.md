PassSafe is a password manager for iOS made by Hamdi Vazim.

**NOTE:** the app will _not_ work without `GoogleService-Info.plist` in the root of the Xcode workspace. You will need to create your own Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore enabled and use its config file if you would like to try the app out. (Learn how to do that here.)[https://hamdivazim.github.io/tutor3]

## How to get an Early Preview
Clone this repository, or download the `zip` file from GitHub Releases, and open `PassSafe/` in Xcode. Add your own `GoogleService-Info.plist` file into the root (add to all targets) and run the app on your phone or in the simulator. The app is still very far from release and **is only a TEST.** You may use it normally at your own risk. You must make sure your Firebase project is _fully_ secure.
## How YOU can help
Further into development, I may allow a couple of contributors to commit to PassSafe. For now, you can help by opening pull requests or pointing out on issues.
